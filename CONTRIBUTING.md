## Contribution Guidelines

- Use Comments
  - Make sure to not use too many, because if and when someone
  tries to change the code, they will also have to change all
  of your comments for it to still be accurate.
  
  - Make them short, simple, and easy to read and understand.
  
- Standalone
  - Try to make your code not require additional dependencies, but
  if it does then make sure that it is embedded inside the program.
  We want it to be easy and minimal to install for everyone
  on all platforms, but a few dependencies are fine.
  
- Open Source
  - Do not obfuscate or attempt to hide the source of any code
  that you contribute, as it is free and open source software.
  
- Formatting
  - Do not minify any code that you contribute, keep it all
  clean and easy to read and understand.
