# BracketScript

An open-source programming language that's a cross between C++ and Python, which adopts
a Python-like syntax while still having some of the mid-level features of C++. The goal
is to produce a mix between the two that is both powerful yet easy to learn and use for
both experienced programmers and beginners.

It is still in the early stages of productions, and we are looking for more contributors
who would like to help out with the project. If you know C#, Assembly, or another language
that you could use to contribute to BracketScript feel free to reach out.

As of right now the compiler's lexer is written in Lua, and possibly other parts of the compiler in the future,

## Contribution Guidelines

- Use Comments
  - Make sure to not use too many, because if and when someone
  tries to change the code, they will also have to change all
  of your comments for it to still be accurate.
  
  - Make them short, simple, and easy to read and understand.
  
- Standalone
  - Try to make your code not require additional dependencies, but
  if it does then make sure that it is embedded inside the program.
  We want it to be easy and minimal to install for everyone
  on all platforms, but a few dependencies are fine.
  
- Open Source
  - Do not obfuscate or attempt to hide the source of any code
  that you contribute, as it is free and open source software.
  
- Formatting
  - Do not minify any code that you contribute, keep it all
  clean and easy to read and understand.
