# BracketScript

An open-source programming language that's a cross between C++ and Python, which adopts
a Python-like syntax while still having some of the mid-level features of C++. The goal
is to produce a mix between the two that is both powerful yet easy to learn and use for
both experienced programmers and beginners.

It is still in the early stages of productions, and we are looking for more contributors
who would like to help out with the project. If you know C#, Assembly, or another language
that you could use to contribute to BracketScript feel free to reach out.

As of right now the compiler's lexer is written in Lua, and possibly other parts of the compiler in the future,
